	VS Code uses TypeScript 1.5 in the box. If you want to use a newer version of TypeScript,
	you can define the typescript.tsdk setting. The value of this setting is the absolute path
	to the lib folder of a TypeScript installation. This folder contains the file tsserver.js
	and the corresponding lib.*.d.ts files. Refer to this blog post for how to install the
	nightly builds of TypeScript.

	To make it easier to try out the very latest in TypeScript, we're now publishing the TypeScript nightly npm package.  You can try this out using:

	npm install -g typescript@next
	
	We've set this to update each night, and we timestamp each release.  You can see what version you're on with the --version commandline switch:
	
	C:\Users>tsc --version
	message TS6029: Version 1.6.0-dev.20150727
